# Signboard-Translation-from-Vernacular-Languages


The goal of this project is to transliterate the text written on a signboard to another language as desired by the user (Typically 1 language transliteration due to the complexity involved). We will first design a system which works for names (such as road names, city names, organisation names shop names etc.) which typically contain 1-2 words and are rarely longer than 4-5 words. We implemented this using Machine Learning algorithms which performs object detection, text recognition, optical character recognition tools and Seq2Seq modelling.
